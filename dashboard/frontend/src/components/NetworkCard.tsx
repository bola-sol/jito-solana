 * it measures: Linux attributes bytes to an interface and not to a process, so
 * anything else running on the box is counted too. On a dedicated validator the
 * two are near enough the same, which is exactly why the distinction has to be
 * on the card rather than left to the reader to guess.
 *
 * A row each, but one scale across both. Given a band of its own, a direction
 * moving ten kilobytes a second fills it exactly as a direction moving ten
 * megabytes does, and the picture would say the two are equals. Sharing the
 * scale is the reason both are worth putting on one card.
 *
 * The card renders nothing at all when the validator could not read the
 * counters, rather than showing zeros that would look like an idle network.
