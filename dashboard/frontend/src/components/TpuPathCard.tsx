/**
 * Everything that happens to a transaction before the scheduler sees it.
 *
 * The card is here whenever a QUIC port has taken a connection at any point in
 * this process's life, rather than whenever one took a connection lately. That
 * is the point of it: the two sections at the foot go quiet between leader
 * slots, and the card this replaces left the grid entirely whenever they did,
 * so an operator with few slots could rarely open the dashboard at a moment it
 * was there to read.
 *
 * Two shapes, chosen by whether the address this validator advertises for its
 * TPU is a socket on this host. It is not behind a relayer or a proxy, and the
 * layout for that is on `Elsewhere` below.
 *
 * Five sections, each drawn against its own total. They do not reconcile and
 * are not meant to: the door counts connections, the streams count streams, and
 * the three below count transactions, measured by three subsystems on three
 * cadences. A single chain across them would look authoritative and be quietly
 * wrong, so each restarts at its own hundred percent under its own heading.
 *
 * The last two are counted over a different span as well as against a different
 * total. Both only run while this validator is leader, and five minutes of a
 * stage that fires for a handful of slots every few hours reports whether a
 * leader slot happened to fall inside the window rather than anything about the
 * stage. They are summed over the epoch instead, which is the span the leader
 * schedule is drawn over and the stake behind it is fixed for. The two are
 * bracketed together under one caption that says so, rather than each carrying
 * a label of its own: they are summed on the same tick over the same slots, and
 * two copies of that fact are two chances to disagree about it.
 *
 * What the scheduler did with what arrived is not here. It is per leader slot
 * and it is on the slot page, joined to the block it produced, which is where a
 * figure that only exists during leader slots belongs.
