/**
 * Slots fetched from the validator's packed history, rather than pushed.

 * cheaper form and asked for a span at a time. This turns a span of that back
 * into the entries the schedule page already knows how to draw, so nothing
 * downstream has to know where a turn came from.
 *
 * What comes back is a reconstruction, not the original. The packed row carries
 * the figures a schedule row shows and no others, so the fields outside that
 * read as nought here: failed transactions and entries are absent rather than
 * zero, and anything drawing them from these entries would be drawing a number
 * that was never measured. Priority fees used to be among them and are now
 * carried, because the schedule page draws the two kinds of fee apart and a
 * split that vanished as a reader scrolled back would be worse than none.
